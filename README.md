## What is Quidditch Legacy?
Quidditch Legacy is the ultimate solution for fans of Hogwarts Legacy who yearn to fulfill their Quidditch fantasies within the game.

Take to the skies and unleash your imagination as you create custom Quidditch teams and compositions, unrestricted by the rigid rules and regulations of traditional Quidditch.

With Quidditch Legacy, you can bring together iconic characters, such as Voldemort and Harry Potter, onto the same team, transcending the boundaries of the Wizarding world. Build your dream teams, design and customize your players, and amass a collection of broomsticks to embark on unforgettable Quidditch adventures.
